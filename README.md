# 1.Write a Python program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not.
The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated
sequence.
Example:
0100,0011,1010,1001
Then the output should be:
1010
## Code:
```
numbers = input().split(",")
result = []
for n in numbers:
    if int(n, 2) % 5 == 0:
        result.append(n)
print(",".join(result))
```
## Output:

# 2.Write a Python program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number ofletters and digits.
Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
hello world! 123
Then, the output should be:
LETTERS 10
DIGITS 3
## Code:
```
s=input()
letters=0
digits=0
for ch in s:
  if ch.isalpha():
    letters+=1
  if ch.isdigit():
    digits+=1
print("Letters: ",letters)
print("Digits: ",digits)
```
## Output:

# 3.Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers.
The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single
line.Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:8
Then, the output should be:40320
## Code:
```
num=(input().split(","))
res=[]
for a in num:
  a=int(a)
  fact=1
  for i in range(1,a+1):
    fact=fact*i;
  res.append(str(fact))
print(res)
```
## Output:
